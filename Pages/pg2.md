## What is disc golf?
### Disc golf is a sport with discs and baskets. It's as simple as it sounds - the goal is to try and throw the disc into the basket with as little attempts as possible. The discs look like frisbees, but fly differently. They are heavier, and require more practice. The rules of disc dolf are similar to regular golf - you have birdies, pars, etc. You also keep score similarly. The average drive (first throw off a tee) is around 300 feet. Disc golf courses are in nature - you can find courses in the woods, fields, rocky areas, etc. Generally disc golf is also free to play, with no price for admission. It's a great sport to get out in nature and also spend some time with people and be social. It's also a great way to get some walking in.
