## What are small form factor computers?  
## Small form factor computers (SFFPCs) are smaller computers that are used like any other computer.  
## They are generally smaller than a certain size (measured in volume/liters), and consist of a micro-ATX or mini-ITX motherboard. In the past, SFFPCs were difficult to build and not popular due to the requirements of low temperatures and it was just the trend to have a large computer tower with a lot of large components. It's getting more popular to have smaller cases with a mini-ITX motherboard and a SFX(small form factor) power-supply. From a performance perspective, SFFPC's benchmark pretty well against mid and full sized towers, however the thermals are not usually as good (they tend to run hot).

## **Advantages to having a SFFPC**  
* ## Much smaller computer, takes up less space  
* ## Use every part of the computer case, very efficient  
* ## **Very** quiet

## **Cons of having SFFPC**
* ## Need to plan out the build much more carefully
* ## Some of the largest components on the market might not fit
* ## Won't run as cool as mid or full size tower
